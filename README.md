## Hyprland & most of Hypr\* ecosystem

Based on [end-4/dots-hyprland](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland) but without ags amd tons of other stuff.

## Eww

-   `main`, main dashboard, modified from [syndrizzle/hotfiles](https://github.com/syndrizzle/hotfiles/tree/bspwm) without notification center.
-   `lyrics`, scrolling lyrics player, dependents on api from [akashrchandran/spotify-lyrics-api](https://github.com/akashrchandran/spotify-lyrics-api) and [a small program](https://github.com/Uyanide/spotify-lyrics) from myself <small>(which also happens to be my frist Golang program :D)</small>.
-   `lyrics-single`, similar to `lyrics`, but limited to a single line and therefore fits well in statusbars.

## Grub theme

Based on [vinceliuice/Elegant-grub2-themes](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Elegant-grub2-themes) with [illustration from 紺屋鴉江](https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/119683453)

## Waybar

Gathered from internet, based on <s>I don't know who</s> (such config files had been laying in my disk before I could even notice and already looked nice without further configurations) (and I'm pretty sure they were not the default config files shipped with the waybar package)

## Fonts

including:

-   MesloLGM Nerd Font (& Mono)
-   Maple Mono Normal CN
-   Font Awesome 6 Free
-   Noto Sans
-   ...
