## Waybar

Gathered from internet, based on <s>I don't know who</s> (such config files had been laying in my disk before I could even notice and already looked nice without further configurations) (and I'm pretty sure they were not the default config files shipped with the waybar package)

## Fonts

Not unified, combination of:

-   MesloLGM Nerd Font (& Mono)
-   Maple Mono Normal CN
-   Font Awesome 6 Free
-   Noto Sans
